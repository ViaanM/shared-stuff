                <h2>WARNING: you need Visual Studio Code to follow</h2>
                <h3>1. The basics</h3>
                <br>The first thing you need to know is that < and > to code. The and in the middle can resemble a command.
                <h3>2. How to change sizes of text</h3>
                <br>To change sizes of text you will need to type h then the size you want in the two symbols. h1 is largest and h6 is smallest. 
                <br>Examples:
                <h1>h1</h1>
                <h2>h2</h2>
                <h3>h3</h3>
                <h4>h4</h4>
                <h5>h5</h5>
                <h6>h6</h6>
                <h3>3. New paragraphs</h3>
                <br>There are two ways to add new paragraphs; use the br command or the p command.
                <br>Examples:
